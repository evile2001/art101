			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The objective of this lab was to experiment with javascript, assigning variables and adjusting them to respond to our commands.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had an issue where VSCode said that my javascript code was incorrect in the placement of a semicolon but I couldn't figure out why because it matched the example in the assignment instructions so I talked it through with my partner Autania and WesBot and eventually fixed it whcih also fixed the issue of getting the javascript file to link to my Lab 5 html.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think that this assignment is a good way for us to get more comfortable with javascript commands and I would say it was one of the less time consuming labs but it still had value in the end.</p>
