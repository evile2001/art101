                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab is to go back and debug any issues we had with our javascript in previous labs.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I previously had issues with lab 9 so I decided to go back and fix that with the help of my partner and WesBot to catch issues with my code that I probably wouldn't have caught without them as a tool. It turns out I literally just hadn't added a css section for the button to use to change the visuals of the site.</p>
