                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab is to incorporate jQuery into our code and experiment with it.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had a bit of trouble geting the buttons to work so I talked with my partner and WesBot about it and it turned out that I just had some typos which can be hard to catch.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I think that this lab was interesting for learning the basics and I would be interested to know how to generate buttons that have actions (lol if they're supposed to do something and I just did it wrong.)</p>

                <p>The results are the buttons!</p>
