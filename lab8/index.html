                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab is to program functions that operate when certain things spark them.</p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had so much trouble figuring this one out. I had to talk to my parter, a friend who majors in CS, and WesBot in order to kind of figure it out and even then I'm not confident in it.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This lab was very difficult for me and caused a lot of stress. What I did in the experimental space of the console could not be replicated properly in the VSCode javascript file; I kept trying it and it wasn't working. I ended up replicating what was given as an example in the assignment instructions and I think it worked? Again, I'm not confident.</p>
