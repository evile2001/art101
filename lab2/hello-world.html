            <p>I'm Emma! My partner Autania is really intelligent. She has kind eyes and her demeanor lives up to them. I've learned that she likes cats like I do and she loves redwoods, saying the trees are her favorite part of Santa Cruz. Problem solving with her makes our work so much easier and more enjoyable to do.</p>
