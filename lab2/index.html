			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The intention was for us to learn to code an html site and use css to style it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We both had some trouble figuring out how to upload images but worked through it together. There were other coding issues along the way that we solved through trial and error, or by asking our fellow students, our TA, and wesbot which we both love. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I would say that we both put a lot of energy into this assignment which was at times frustrating but turned out to be rewarding in the end and along the way and as we solved individual problems.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We decided to use our sites to write bios of each other, so by working together we created pages for one another.</p>
