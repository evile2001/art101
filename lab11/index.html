                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab was to develop a javascript code that would create a button on the html page where users can input their name and have it returned to them in a jumbled manner, just as we did in a previous lab but this time it is within the page and not a pop-up that appears when you first open it.</p>

            <div id="problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had some issues getting the javascript to work properly because I was misformatting it but after talking to my partner and WesBot I was able to catch my mistake and repair it.</p>

            <div id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I think that this is a cool and useful feature to learn as a variation of what you can do with javascript.</p>
