                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The point of this lab is first for us to gain some kind of independence by creating our own folder and it's contents for lab 7. We then were tasked with working out a javascript function and proving it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I got a little mixed up with creating the folder for lab 7 and organizing it in the proper order so everything would function properly but through trial and error I eventually got things to work out to match previous labs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Overall I think that this lab was helpful in further figuring out how to navigate VS Code and also to begin using javascript functions which will be helpful in developing the group project to make a more elaborate site.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>In the end I was left with a beautiful lab 7 folder and a function that functions.</p>
