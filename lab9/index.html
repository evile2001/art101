                <p>I had a bit of trouble getting the buttons to work because I didn't really get what they were supposed to do (I hadn't looked at Wes' example) but once I figured it out I realized I just had to clean up my js a bit with the help of my partner and add a section to my css called ".special" to actually make the button change the appearance.</p>
