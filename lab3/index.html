			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to create and edit files, organize file structures, and be able to navigate them both in the code editor and in the browser.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have any major problems here as long as I followed the instructions step by step. My only memorable issue was when I originally uploaded my home page photo and it was very very large so I had to go back in and set the width to make it more manageable. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I felt like this assignment was fairly straightforward and I didn't have any frustrations with it or times where I felt like I really didn't understand. A lot of it was repeating mechanisms from previous labs which is helpful to build my confidence in those skills. I put enough energy into it to do it right, I think, but at no point did I feel burnt out which I'm grateful for. </p>
