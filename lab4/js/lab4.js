//Generate light blue sky with white clouds as background
//Generate pipes of different lengths that come out from the top and bottom of the screen
    //Leave gaps between the top and bottom pipes
    //Alternate the lengths of the pipes as you move through the map
//Generate a little yellow bird, movement controlled by player’s space bar
    //Objective is for bird to pass through the pipes without hitting them
//When the bird hits the pipe, add large “Game Over” graphic
//Regenerate and go again
