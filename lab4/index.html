			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The objective of the lab was to create lists that describe the processes of certain tasks and games. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't know how to format an indented list in html so we asked someone who told us about using " < l i > " in order to do so. (Had to separate all the letters and punctuation out so it didn't actually do the function lol)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was one of the more fun assignments we've had so far because we got to take some things that we were familiar with and think about how to describe them step by step to other people and also in a way that a computer would understand. We appreciated this beginning step in understanding how javascript processes information piece by piece.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h2>Pseudocode an Everyday Task</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Identify what you would like to paint</li>
							<li>Gather supplies</li>
							<li>Colored paint, paint brushes, canvas of any size, easel, paint palette, water, washing cups, smock, varnish</li>
							<li>Go to location</li>
							<li>Set up easel and canvas</li>
							<li>Put on smock to protect your clothes from paint</li>
							<li>Identify colors of paint you will use to replicate the scene you want to paint</li>
							<li>Squeeze paint on to pallet in small dollops</li>
							<li>Use brush to apply paint to canvas</li>
							<li>Apply background colors first</li>
							<li>Let paint dry between layers</li>
							<li>Wash brush in water before using a new color to prevent cross contamination</li>
							<li>Layer paint to mimic scenery</li>
							<li>Copy what you see at location in your own individual art style</li>
							<li>Paint small details over large details</li>
							<li>Add lighter colored paints as highlights</li>
							<li>Admire your painting as it dries</li>
							<li>Add signature</li>
							<li>After painting is completely dry, add varnish if you want and wait to dry</li>
							<li>Wash brushes, remove smock, pack up suppllies</li>
							<li>Take home painting</li>
							<li>Hang it up on your wall or give it to a friend</li>
							</li>
						</ul>

				<h2>Pseudocode a Game</h2>
				<p>Flappy Bird Computer Directions
					<ul>
						<li>Generate light blue sky with white clouds as background</li>
						<li>Generate pipes of different lengths that coe out from the top and bottom of the screen</li>
						<li>Leave gaps between the top and bottom pipes</li>
						<li>Alternate the lengths of the pipes as you move through the map</li>
						<li>Generate a little yellow bird, movemnet controlled by player space bar</li>
						<li>Objective is for bird to pass through pipes without hitting them</li>
						<li>When the bird hits the pipe, add large "Game Over" graphic</li>
						<li>Regenerate and go again</li>
					</ul>
