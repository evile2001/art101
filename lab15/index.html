                <p>So many problems! First I thought I knew how to do the button function and call on an api but then it wasn't working so I looked at Wes' code in the lab example and tried what was there but it still wasn't working so I asked WesBot and they said to check the console (I always forget) and it turns out that the api I was trying to use was blocked by something on my computer I guess. So then I had WesBot suggest ones that wouldn't be blocked and ended up with one that guesses your age based on your name so I had to change the generate button to a prompt that asks you for your name. It was a whole thing but it works now!</p>
