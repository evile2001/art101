                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab was to create a conditional function.</p>

            <div id="problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I didn't have any major problems with this one.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>I've been wanting to make art like those early 2000s teen magazines that were all colorful and had those little quizzes about girlhood and celebrity crushes and stuff, so I decided to make this lab into something inspired by those by having the pink theme and personalizing the function to ask a question that I think would've been in one of those mags in the 60s.</p>

                Please enter your full name so I can decide:

                <button id="button">Submit</button>
