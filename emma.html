            <p>I've got a thing I keep fucking up said thing I keep thinking about old things when it's all supposed to be new I'm not nice I'm not smart I'm not ready I'm all good I'm not eating I'm just sitting I have bad posture I have a metal rod in my back. I want to be good.</p>
            <p>I've got a boy who I don't got I want him and I don't I miss him and I hate him and he texts me when he's in town then leaves me on read and he's not special but he is and he was my first kiss and he's really an asshole, long and short. I've got a new boy and he's being taken for granted. I'm taking him for granted. He's 58 miles away.</p>

            <p>I've got a long shot dream of grad school. I've got emails out to professionals. I've got letters of recommendation incoming. I've got letters I'll never receive. I've got a search history that reads "eating disorder clinics near me." I've gotta eat.</p>
            <p>I want to be a professor. I want to be a girlfriend but maybe not a wife and definitely a mother. I want a son with hair like mine and I want my brother to call me more.</p>
            <p>I want my mom to be okay and I want that more than anything.</p>
            <p>I'm so grateful to have girlfriends. I love having girlfriends. I feel truly loved by my girlfriends. I never question if they think I'm pretty or funny or cool. I think they love me even when I'm not drunk enough to dance with them.</p>
            <p>I love drag queens.</p>
            <p>My new boyfriend who's not my boyfriend texted me at 12:47 a.m. to say he had a fever of 104.7 and I haven't heard from him since.</p>

            <p>I really don't like getting hit on at bars. It makes me feel like I'm not real. I don't like when men see me but don't know me and still think they want me. That's just lust. I don't feel right the last couple of days. I have work to do that I can't bring myself to start and I just stare at my phone and feel like I'm getting dumber and dumber. Add to that the fact that being dumb makes me feel unloveable. I used to be so much smarter and I had things to talk about and now I just listen. I'm not even much of a writer anymore. I'm in a weird place. I'm in a parking lot.</p>
            <p>I'm making art I'll never share. I'm doing this instead of doing work. I hate work. I'm done with work. I'm craving a Smirnoff Ice. I kind of never want to drink again. I kind of still feel drunk but it's been two days.</p>
