            <p>I've got a thing I keep fucking up said thing I keep thinking about old things when it's all supposed to be new I'm not nice I'm not smart I'm not ready I'm all good I'm not eating I'm just sitting I have bad posture I have a metal rod in my back. I want to be good.</p>
            <p>I've got a boy who I don't got I want him and I don't I miss him and I hate him and he texts me when he's in town then leaves me on read and he's not special but he is and he was my first kiss and he's really an asshole, long and short. I've got a new boy and he's being taken for granted. I'm taking him for granted. He's 58 miles away.</p>

            <p>I've got a long shot dream of grad school. I've got emails out to professionals. I've got letters of recommendation incoming. I've got letters I'll never receive. I've got a search history that reads "eating disorder clinics near me." I've gotta eat.</p>
